# abusive-text-filter

This project aims to create a machine learning model that will tell if your sentence has av=busive text in it or not.
The labelled datasets for this has been downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge/data
and from https://github.com/t-davidson/hate-speech-and-offensive-language/tree/master/data

We have used tensorflow primarily to create the model. I hope it helps! :)
